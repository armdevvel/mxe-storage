# MXE Storage for Project Rakko/Rita

Upon attempting to work on more packages, I (pahaze) have learned that certain ones are being deleted as time goes on due to them being obsolete. We still use these packages sometimes, so anything we use will go here to ensure they're safe, not only for us, but also other users, alongside an SHA256SUM file.
